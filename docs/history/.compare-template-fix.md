# Compare Template Fix — v103.1
**Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Issue:** Compare template wasn't rendering  
**Root cause:** Props interface mismatch

---

## 🐛 THE PROBLEM

**User saw:**
1. Article template ✓
2. **Compare template missing** ❌
3. List template ✓

**Expected:** All 3 templates in Shot 2

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE

**Shot Prompt used wrong props:**
```json
{
  "leftTitle": "What Teles Are NOT",
  "rightTitle": "What Teles ARE",
  "rows": [
    { "left": "Chatbots", "right": "Workers" }
  ]
}
```

**Compare Component expects:**
```typescript
{
  columns: CompareColumn[];
}

interface CompareColumn {
  icon?: string;
  title: string;
  items: string[];
  variant: 'bad' | 'good';
  highlight?: boolean;
}
```

**Mismatch:** Props didn't match interface → Component didn't render

## ✅ THE FIX

### Updated Shot 2:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "leftTitle": "What Teles Are NOT",
  "rightTitle": "What Teles ARE",
  "rows": [...]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "columns": [
    {
      "icon": "X",
      "title": "What Teles Are NOT",
      "items": ["Chatbots with scripts", "Assistants waiting", "Software you learn"],
      "variant": "bad"
    },
    {
      "icon": "Check",
      "title": "What Teles ARE",
      "items": ["Workers with reasoning", "Labor that acts", "Workers that learn you"],
      "variant": "good",
      "highlight": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Updated Template Documentation:

**Before:**
```json
{ "leftTitle": "Software", "rightTitle": "Labor", "rows": [{ "left": "Learn it", "right": "It learns you" }] }
```

**After:**
```json
{ "columns": [{ "icon": "X", "title": "Software", "items": ["Learn it", "Adapt to it"], "variant": "bad" }, { "icon": "Check", "title": "Labor", "items": ["It learns you", "Adapts to you"], "variant": "good", "highlight": true }] }
```

## 💡 LESSON LEARNED

**Always verify template prop interfaces** before documenting shot prompts.

The Compare template documentation in glass-prompt.md was outdated—it showed a simplified interface that didn't match the actual component. This caused:
1. Shot prompts to use wrong props
2. Template to fail silently
3. User to see gaps in the experience

**Fixed both:**
1. Shot prompt props
2. Template documentation example

_Compare template now renders correctly in all shot prompts._
