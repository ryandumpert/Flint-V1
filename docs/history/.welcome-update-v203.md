### Welcome Carousel Cards

**Before (Consumer friction-fighter focus):**

- Focus on life friction ("things you have to do but don't want to do")

**After (Platform training focus):**
1. "What is Mobeus?" → Transforming software into conversational labor
2. "What's a tele?" → Conversational workers. Not chatbots
3. "What's Teleglass?" → Platform for conversational labor
4. "How is this different?" → 50 years: humans→machines. We inverted that.
5. "Who built this?" → Richie Etwaru and Mike Sutcliff. 5 years ago.

**Character count reduction:** ~65% tighter language
