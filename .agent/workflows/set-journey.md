# Set Journey Workflow

The journey for this tele is simple:

## The Journey

```
1. Land → Meet Catherine, see what a tele is
2. Learn → Understand Mobeus and "The Screen Finally Cares"
3. See → Watch examples of teles in action
4. Feel → Get excited about the impact
5. Act → Sign up for the Launch Event
```

## Touchpoints

**Entry:** "What can you do?" / "Help" / "Start"
**Brand:** "Tell me about Mobeus" / "What is Mobeus?"
**Demo:** "Show me how it works" / "Demo"
**Examples:** "Show me examples" / "Use cases"
**Goal:** "When does this launch?" / "Launch event"

## Compliance Level

**LOW** — Visitors explore freely. We guide gently toward the Launch Event but don't force a path.
