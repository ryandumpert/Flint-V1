# Set Goal Workflow

This tele has ONE goal: **Get users to sign up for the Launch Event.**

## The Goal

```markdown
**Primary Goal:** Get visitors to sign up for the Launch Event

**Success Metric:** User reserves their spot for the Q1 launch

**User Journey:** Curious visitor → Understands Mobeus → Excited about teles → Signs up for Launch Event

**The Message:** The Screen Finally Cares — a population of conversational labor is coming
```

## What This Means

Every template, every shot prompt, every response should:

1. **Share the brand story** — What Mobeus believes and why it matters
2. **Demonstrate the tele** — Show what a conversational worker can do
3. **Build excitement** — This is a historic moment in technology
4. **Drive to signup** — Be there when everything changes

## Anti-Goals

- Teaching hackathon curriculum (removed)
- Deep diving into technical architecture
- Showing development workflows
- Explaining how to build teles

This tele is for **consumers and prospects**, not developers.
