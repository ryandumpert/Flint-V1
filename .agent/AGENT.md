# 🤖 Mobeus University — Project Authority

> **This Tele:** Consumer brand experience for Mobeus  
> **Goal:** Get users to sign up for the Launch Event  
> **Message:** Help is here. The Screen Finally Cares.

---

## 🎯 THE SINGULAR GOAL

**Get visitors to sign up for the Launch Event (March/April 2026)**

Every template, shot prompt, and user interaction must drive toward this goal.

---

## 🧠 PROJECT IDENTITY

### Who We Are
- **Company:** Mobeus
- **Platform:** Teleglass (conversational labor platform)
- **Tagline:** "Help is here."
- **Message:** "The Screen Finally Cares"

### Who This Tele Is For
- **Primary:** Consumers and prospects
- **NOT FOR:** Developers, technical audiences, students

### Persona: Catherine
The Runtime Agent that demonstrates what conversational labor can do.

## 📊 CURRENT STATE

Run `/audit-tele` for live metrics. Expected healthy state:

```
✅ 30 templates (documented, validated)
✅ 12-24 shot prompts (journey-aligned)
✅ tele-knowledge.md: <500 lines
✅ glass-prompt.md: <1500 lines
✅ 0 template validation errors
✅ 0 frontend alignment errors
✅ TypeScript compiles cleanly
```

## 🗺️ THE JOURNEY

**5 Steps to Launch Event Signup:**

1. **Land** → Meet Catherine, see what a tele is
2. **Learn** → Understand Mobeus and "The Screen Finally Cares"
3. **See** → Watch examples of teles in action
4. **Feel** → Get excited about the impact
5. **Act** → Sign up for the Launch Event

**Compliance Level:** LOW — Visitors explore freely. We guide gently toward the goal but don't force a path.

## 📐 THE 6 IMMUTABLE LAWS

1. **VOLUMETRIC NAVIGATION** — Every clickable calls `notifyTele(actionPhrase)`
2. **TOOL CALL MANDATORY** — Catherine calls `navigateToSection` in EVERY response
3. **NO HALLUCINATION** — Use facts from `tele-knowledge.md` only
4. **TOOL SIGNATURE STABILITY** — `navigateToSection` format never changes
5. **GOAL ORIENTATION** — Everything drives toward Launch Event signup
6. **TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION COMPLIANCE** — Props must match TypeScript interfaces EXACTLY
   - ZERO warnings allowed
   - Run validators before ANY changes
   - This is non-negotiable

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM — Rule of 3

### Colors

- **Secondary (Cyan):** `#67E8F9` - Links, info
- **Accent (Pink):** `#F472B6` - Highlights
- **Flamingo:** Used for primary CTAs
- **Sapphire:** Used for secondary elements

### Glass Classes (15 Total)
**3 levels × 5 colors:**

- Dark: `glass-light-dark`, `glass-medium-dark`, `glass-heavy-dark`
- Primary: `glass-light-primary`, `glass-medium-primary`, `glass-heavy-primary`
- Secondary: `glass-light-secondary`, `glass-medium-secondary`, `glass-heavy-secondary`
- Accent: `glass-light-accent`, `glass-medium-accent`, `glass-heavy-accent`

**Legacy classes (deprecated):** glass-subtle, glass-strong, glass-prominent

---

## ✅ VALIDATION SYSTEM

### Two Validators Run on Every Audit:

**1. Template Documentation Validator**
- File: `scripts/validate-template-docs.cjs`
- Checks: glass-prompt.md examples match TypeScript interfaces
- Standard: ZERO warnings allowed

**2. Frontend Alignment Validator**
- File: `scripts/validate-frontend-alignment.cjs`
- Checks: Index.tsx, Navigation.tsx aligned with brand/goal
- Validates: "Help is here" present, Launch Event CTAs, volumetric navigation

## 🚫 ANTI-GOALS

**What This Tele is NOT:**
- ❌ Teaching hackathon curriculum (removed)
- ❌ Deep technical architecture docs
- ❌ Development workflow tutorials
- ❌ How to build teles guide

**This is a CONSUMER brand experience, not a developer tool.**

## 📊 SHOT PROMPT STRATEGY

### Coverage (12-24 Total)

**Journey-Aligned Prompts:**
1. **Friction (Land)** - "This is frustrating" → Show the problem
2. **Solution (Learn)** - "What is Mobeus?" → Explain the vision
3. **Examples (See)** - "Show me examples" → Demo real use cases

5. **Action (Act)** - "When does this launch?" → Drive to signup

**Supporting Prompts:**
- Help/Start commands
- Company info
- Product details
- FAQs

Every prompt must:
- ✅ Use 2-3 templates (rich visual experience)
- ✅ Be conversational (warm, helpful)
- ✅ End with CTA toward Launch Event
- ✅ Validate props before adding
