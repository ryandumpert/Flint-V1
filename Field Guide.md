Field Guide
Commercial scope and positioning
What is AI-Works from a commercial perspective?
AI-Works is an agentic software development, operations, and management platform available as a licensed set of platform components complemented by optional services and accelerators. It is not a resale of third-party AI models.  It is not a bespoke AI platform built for individual clients. 
What is included in the AI-Works platform versus delivered separately?
The platform includes a runtime, orchestration, governance, and standard analytics enabling different capabilities - including code to spec, requirements enhancements, a proprietary context library, a proprietary component library, a proprietary capability and industry solution library, dynamic super spec generation, spec to code generation, and AIOps.  Custom AI development, advanced integrations, or bespoke analytics are delivered as separate, clearly scoped engagements.
How should AI-Works be positioned relative to traditional services?
AI-Works is the foundation that enables scalable AI delivery of high quality enterprise software enabling an entirely new software development, maintenance, and modernization lifecycle.  Services accelerate adoption and value, but do not replace the platform.
Is AI-Works a product, a platform, or a service?
AI-Works is a platform offering, licensed on a subscription and consumption basis, with optional services layered on top.  AI-Works does generate a recurring stream of code which is constantly updated with regulatory, cybersecurity, functional, and technical supply chain modifications so clients can choose to subscribe to the code base generated by the platform on a recurring basis to replace their existing code base maintenance contracts.
Licensing Model
How is AI-Works licensed?
AI-Works is licensed via a subscription with consumption pricing based on token usage, granting the right to use the platform within an agreed scope.
Is AI-Works sold as a subscription or project-based offering?
The platform is always subscription-based.  Projects apply only to implementation, configuration, or custom use case development.
Is AI-Works licensed per client, per entity, or enterprise-wide?
Licensing is typically enterprise-scoped, with commercial tiers reflecting scale, complexity, and usage profile.
Does the license grant exclusivity or special rights?
No. AI-Works is non-exclusive and designed as a shared, continuously evolving platform.  Clients may choose to develop their own company-specific enhancements to the context library and apply those enhancements as they use the platform.
Deployment & Hosting
Where is AI-Works hosted by default?
AI-Works is delivered as a managed platform, operated and maintained centrally.
Can AI-Works be deployed in a client environment?
Client-hosted deployments are not the default and require explicit review due to operational and IP implications.  This will change over time as the platform evolves.
Is on-prem or air-gapped deployment supported?
These scenarios are considered exceptional and evaluated case by case.
Who is responsible for operating and maintaining the platform?
Platform operations, upgrades, and security are handled centrally by the AI-Works team to ensure consistency and scalability.

Models & AI Assets
Does AI-Works include foundation models?
AI-Works provides orchestrated access to approved models, abstracted behind the platform.
Can clients request a custom or dedicated model?
Not yet. AI-Works is not yet positioned to deliver bespoke foundation models per client.
Is model fine-tuning supported?
Fine-tuning is not part of the standard offering and requires explicit approval and separate commercial treatment.
Are third-party or client-provided models supported?
They will be supported where they can be integrated safely within AI-Works governance and operational controls.

Customisation vs Configuration
What configuration is included in AI-Works?
Configuration includes prompts, workflows, thresholds, policies, and integrations within the platform’s standard capabilities.
What is considered “custom development”?
Any change requiring new logic, new workflows, or new integrations beyond standard configuration.
When does a request move from platform usage to a separate engagement?
When it introduces client-specific logic, build effort, or operational responsibility beyond the platform baseline.  To be clear, the platform can accept and process client specific context library or component library assets.

Commercial Model & Pricing Logic
How is AI-Works priced at a high level?
Pricing is value- and entitlement-based, reflecting scope, scale, and complexity — not raw technical consumption.
Is pricing based on tokens, compute, or usage?
The primary pricing logic is based on subscription fees for different levels of usage.  Where appropriate, specific token consumption costs will be charged to clients, but at this point in time the tokens and compute are internally metered for control and not used as pricing units.
What drives price differences between clients or tiers?
Factors include number of users, enabled capabilities, environments, governance needs, and expected scale.
How are additional capabilities or scale handled commercially?
Through tier uplift or add-ons, not per-unit consumption pricing.

Usage, Metering & Limits
Is AI-Works usage unlimited?
Usage is subject to a fair-use envelope aligned to enterprise usage patterns.
What is meant by “fair use”?
Usage consistent with the licensed scope and expected adoption profile of the client.
What happens if usage significantly exceeds expectations?
Sustained excess usage triggers a commercial review, not automatic penalties.
Is usage monitored, and for what purpose?
Yes — for platform stability, security, governance, and commercial alignment.

Data Usage & Rights
How is client data used within AIWorks
Client data is used only to deliver agreed use cases, under strict access controls.
Is client data used to train models?
No, unless explicitly agreed in writing under separate terms.
Can data be reused across clients?
No. Data remains logically segregated and protected.
How is sensitive or regulated data handled?
Through built-in governance, access controls, and compliance mechanisms.

Governance, Risk & Compliance

What governance controls are built into AIWorks?
Auditability, access control, policy enforcement, and traceability are built in by default.
Can governance controls be disabled or bypassed?
No. Governance is mandatory for all AIWorks usage.
How are audit and compliance requirements supported?
Through logging, reporting, and integration with enterprise compliance processes.

Support & Operations

What support is included with AIWorks?
Standard platform support and operational monitoring are included.
Are different support tiers available?
Yes, enhanced SLAs may be offered as add-ons.
Who handles incidents or platform issues?
Platform operations teams manage incidents in line with agreed SLAs.

Commercial Boundaries & Escalation

What types of requests require escalation?
Client-hosted deployments, bespoke models, IP exceptions, or non-standard commercial terms.

What are typical requests that fall outside standard AI-Works scope?
Custom model builds, unlimited usage guarantees, governance opt-outs.

Who approves non-standard commercial or IP terms?
Commercial leadership in coordination with Legal and Platform governance.
